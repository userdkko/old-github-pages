# Jekyll*ized* version of Identity by HTML5 UP

This is a fork of the original [Identity](https://html5up.net/uploads/demos/identity/#)
design by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net). I've re-factored the code to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
so that it can be hosted with Github Pages. This also allows for auto-compilation of the [Sass](http://sass-lang.cpm)
to CSS. The design is also responsive, powered by [Skel](http://skel.io).

You can see a demo [here](http://mrhornsby.github.io/html5up-identity).
